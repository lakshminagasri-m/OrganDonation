  <h2>🧠 About the Kidney:</h2>
  <p>
    The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs located on either side of the spine. They play a vital role in filtering waste, balancing fluids, and producing hormones that regulate blood pressure and red blood cells.

  <p>
    Kidney donation can be from a living or deceased donor. Since humans have two kidneys and can live with one, living donation is common and lifesaving.
